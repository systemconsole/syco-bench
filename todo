* Test oltp on docker mariadb
  A webservice that connects to a mysql database and performs an oltp benchmark
    # Python docker instance
    # Connect instance to maria db instance
    # From python instance connect sysbench to mariadb
    # Python script that connects sysbench with mariadb.
    # Execute sysbench against mariadb
    # Convert sysbench result to dict/json
    # Store result in sqlite
    # View info as a graph in html.

    # Loop sysbench
    # Analyze the data. What does it mean? What I really need?
    * Test against different settnings?
        * mariadb my1.cnf 1 cpu,  20GB ram, virtualized in KVM
        * mariadb my1.cnf 8 cpu,  40GB ram, virtualized in KVM
        * mariadb my1.cnf 40 cpu, 132GB ram, baremetal

    * sysbench can aparently write json itself
